This project explains what database is, redundancy is and how it differs from backup. Redundancy refers to the practice of storing multiple copies of data or using duplicate resources in a system to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. In the context of a database, redundancy is achieved by maintaining multiple replicas of the same data across different storage devices or servers. The main goal of database redundancy is to minimize the risk of data loss and downtime in case of hardware failures or other issues. This project's objectives such as knowing:
* What is the main role of a database
* What is a database replica
* What is the purpose of a database replica
* Why database backups need to be stored in different physical locations
* What operation should you regularly perform to make sure that your database backup strategy actually works

## Requirements
* vi editor
* Shellcheck (version 0.3.7-5~ubuntu16.04.1)
* Ubuntu 20.04
